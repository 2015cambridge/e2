## Game planning

- Create two color-arrays, each with three possible colors to mix
- Let the computer choose arandom array position to gran a random color from the two color-arrays created
- All positbilities of color mixing - the same result can have two possibilites i.e., blue+yellow is a possibility and yellow+blue is another posibility
- The last result is when two colors are identicals, one of them will be pickeras a result
- Storing the results in an array so we can call them from the view file

## Outside resources

- None - The videos from the course

## Notes for instructor

- I would love to know how to manipulate the index file so it shows the results as color (placeholder images) or HEX colors.
